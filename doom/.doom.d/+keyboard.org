* Colemak config
Following is a configuration for colemak-dh and its wide variant.
** Evil
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! evil-colemak-basics
    :after evil
    :hook (after-init . global-evil-colemak-basics-mode)
    :config
    (setq evil-colemak-basics-rotate-t-f-j nil))
#+end_src

** Window navigation
Fix window hopping
#+begin_src elisp
(after! evil
  (map! :leader
        "w m" 'evil-window-left
        "w n" 'evil-window-down
        "w e" 'evil-window-up
        "w i" 'evil-window-right)
  )
#+end_src

** Ivy
Minibuffer bugged out. This fixes that.
#+begin_src elisp
(after! ivy
  (map! :map ivy-minibuffer-map
        "C-n" 'ivy-next-line
        "C-e" 'ivy-previous-line)

  ;; Makes it behave in the minibuffer
  (map! :leader
        "C-n" 'next-line
        "C-e" 'previous-line))
#+end_src

** TODO Magit
Haven't been able to fix fetch and pull yet. Evil seems to take precedence
#+begin_src elisp
(after! magit
  (map! :map magit-mode-map
        "l" 'magit-log
        "f" 'magit-fetch
        "F" 'magit-pull)
  )
#+end_src
